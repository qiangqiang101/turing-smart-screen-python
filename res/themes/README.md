# How to - theme edition & creation

## Themes
All themes must be moved to this directory to be used by System Monitor.  
A theme consist of its own folder, with its resources (bitmaps) and a `theme.yaml` file

Note: PNG files in the `--Theme examples` folder are examples of themes that could be developed for this program.  
They cannot be used directly as themes because their `theme.yaml` file has not been written yet.  
You can dot it yourself: see below.

## Creation & edition
